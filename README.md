# Hello

My name is Connor and I'm the CTO of Technology Education Collaborative (TEC). I am also the proud owner of Design Hewer LLC. Before I was a programmer and web developer, I studied graphic design and networking. My goal is to help improve the web and make it a better place for both users and developers.
